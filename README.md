What is Ai7?: Its a fun project make COMPLETLY in python without really and modules (execpt random)
Where are the 6 other versions?: This is how many attempts I had to make 7... SEVEN! I made it without ANY Ai help!

How to use: Add your values to GenSeed, RangeSeed1 (first range value CANNOT BE ZERO), RangeSeed2 (last range value), and Range (the range). Then, take the seed (or pretty muce seeds), and add it to PreGuess. Lastly, Take the average to Guess (which justs prints it)

There! A really crappy Ai! Took about 25 minutes of me screaming on how this could work!
